Description
--------------
This is a small addon for `Realistic Item Drops by Funwayguy`.

It replaces the default per game configuration of auto-pickup(corresponding config option becomes irrelevant, and, when this addon is installed, auto-pickup is disabled for all players) with per player in-game configuration.


How To
--------------
You have two options available:  
1. ***toggle auto-pickup*** by pressing a key(defaults to `Z`, can be changed in controls) .  
2. ***hold a key***(default is `ALT` on Windows/`Option` on Mac) to pickup items .
